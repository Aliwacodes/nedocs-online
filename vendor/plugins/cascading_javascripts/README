Cascading Javascripts
=====================

Cascading Javascripts is a plugin that enhances the behaviour of the built-in
javascript_include_tag macro. If :defaults is passed as a parameter, the
javascript_include_tag macro will load the following javascript files (if
present) in order:

  application.js
  #{controller_name/action_name}.js (eg. home/index.js, customers/new.js, etc.)

This allows you to define application-wide and page-specific javascript files
without needing to manually include each one.

To use, simply call javascript_include_tag from application.rhtml including
:defaults as a (or the only) parameter:

  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
          "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
  <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" lang="en" xml:lang="en">
    <head>
      ...
      <%= javascript_include_tag :defaults %>
    </head>
    <body>
      ...
    </body>
  </html>
