Foreign Key Migrations
======================

Foreign Key Migrations is a plugin that automatically generates foreign-key
constraints when creating tables. It uses SQL-92 syntax and as such should be
compatible with most databases that support foreign-key constraints.

The plugin assumes that if you have a column named customer_id that you want a
foreign-key constraint generated that references the id column in the
customer(s) table:

  create_table :orders do |t|
    t.column :customer_id, :integer, :null => false
    ...
  end

If you have multiple columns referencing a table or for whatever reason, your
column name isn't the same as the referenced table name, you can use the
:references option:

  create_table :orders do |t|
    t.column :ordered_by_id, :integer, :null => false, :references => :customers
    ...
  end

If you have a column with a name ending in _id for which you do not wish a
foreign-key to be generated, you can use :references => nil.

The plugin fully supports and understands the following active-record
configuration properties:

	config.active_record.pluralize_table_names
	config.active_record.table_name_prefix

We've also added a method to allow the manual creation of foreign keys from
your migration scripts:

  add_foreign_key( foreign_table_name, foreign_column_names[],
                   primary_table_name, primary_column_names[] )

NOTE: This plugin also requires the Schema Defining plugin.
